## About The Project

Weather Weeb is a creative web application that combines functional weather forecasting with an anime-themed design. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, this project showcases dynamic data handling and user-friendly interface design.  

Key features include:   

- Real-time weather updates powered by Open-Meteo API.    
- Interactive forecast modal for detailed daily weather insights.    
- Icon-based weather representation using Bootstrap Icons.      
- Mobile-first responsive design for a seamless experience across devices.   

This project was designed as an engaging way to practice API integration, DOM manipulation, and Bootstrap styling.      

## Getting Started  

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
* Internet connection to fetch weather data from APIs.

### Installation

1. Clone or download the repository.     
2. Open the index.html file in your browser.    

### Running    

1. Launch the app by opening the index.html file in your browser.    
2. Explore the interactive cards displaying the current weather for four cities: Lakeland, Oradea, Miami, and LA.    
3. Click the "Forecast" link on any card to view the 7-day weather forecast in a modal.    

## Evaluation

Weather Weeb is a fun and functional application that demonstrates proficiency in web development, API integration, and responsive design.   

Strengths:   
- Seamless integration with the Open-Meteo API for real-time data.   
- Intuitive and visually appealing user interface with anime-themed styling.   
- Effective use of Bootstrap for layout and interactivity.   
- Modular JavaScript code with functions promoting readability and reusability.    

Testing:    
- The app was tested across major browsers to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.   
- Edge cases, such as failed API requests and missing data, were handled with graceful degradation.   
- The user experience was validated on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.    

Areas for Improvement:   
- Adding a loading spinner or placeholder during API data fetch.   
- Implementing error messages for cases where data cannot be retrieved.   
- Enhancing the app with user preferences (e.g., unit toggles for Celsius/Fahrenheit).   
- Adding a feature to dynamically select cities.
